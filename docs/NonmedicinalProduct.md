# Nonmedicinalproduct tables

The nonmedicinal export has a couple more undocumented weirdness. 
* The product-id is not documented
* The from- and to-fields in the datablocks aren't documented
* The namespaces for the translation-tags are different here, for no obvious reason

Following fields are documented, but are unused as of now (2022/10/30):
* exFactoryPrice
* publicPrice - no pricing information, unless you count the discounts in the name
* contraceptive - even when contraceptives are in the export, this field is just never filled in
