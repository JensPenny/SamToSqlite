# VMP Tables and quirks

## VTM
* More akin to a reference table in my opinion, but it's good that virtual stuff sits together. 
* This will get referenced later in the Vmp segments

## VMP Group
* `no generic prescription reason` is contained in the reference tables. We just refer to those tables. 
* The same goes for the `no switch reason`
* Field `patientFrailtyIndicator` is documented but is not used in the export.
* Field `singleAdministrationDose` is documented but is not used in the export.

## CommentedClassification
* Also looks more like a reference table, but the rest here is pretty straightforward. 
* Recursive model. The full export of the BCFI chapters found here: https://www.bcfi.be/nl/chapters/1
* Changes frequently, but is widely used by nurses everywhere (so thanks for the export :praise:)
