# RMB tables

## Reimbursementcontext
* Field `exceptional` is documented but is not used in the export. 

### Pricing
* The pricing-part has a unit, but it only has a label. It would be better if this references a base table (or StandardUnit or ucum)

### Reimbursementcriterion
This table duplicates all data, but is referenced in one of the reference tables.
