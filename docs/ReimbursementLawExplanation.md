# RML explanations and quirks
This export looks pretty easy. Just three base-tables, right?  
The hard part starts when you notice that the references can refer to each other. One reference as a chapter can have multiple 
sub-elements. The last element is always a legal text though.  

The docs also mark this as 'deprecated'. See 3.2: Reimbursement Law Definition Part in the documentation. 
However, I'd take a guess and say this data is still needed if you are implementing civars-logic .
```
Deprecated. NIHDI will not be using this structure to model the Reimbursement Law. Instead, only Chapter IV and VIII data will be migrated directly from SAM v1. 

The Reimbursement Law definition will remain in SAM for non-Chapter IV legislation. This legislation did not have Formal Interpretations â€“ that part has been removed completely from SAM.
```

There is a big assumption made in the initial implementation of this parser, and that is that there are **never** more than 
two levels deep of a legal reference. This seems to work for now. The docs seem to allude to max 3 levels though: 
legal basis, legal reference, secondary reference, tertiary reference (addendum), legal text reference. We could model this, 
but that sounds like a problem for future me at this moment.  

I don't get why this is structured the way it is though. Wouldn't it just be easier to condense the damn law-stuff in some kind of redable text? 
This is just absolutely unparseable for any sensible database. Just check the tables that this export vomits out. 

## LegalBasis

## LegalReference
* A legalreference has a field `legalReferencePath'. This is a combined field between basis and the reference keys.
* Field `lastModifiedOn` is documented but is not used in the export.
* I don't really get how legalReferenceTrace should work, so we're going to null it in the export. There are implications in 
the docs here, but that's pretty hard to do in a streaming parser. 

## LegalText
legalRefKey = varchar("key", 70) //Own field to persist the key as well, since legalReferencePath is a combo field
val legalReferencePath
